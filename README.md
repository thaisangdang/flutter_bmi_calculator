# ⚖️ BMI Calculator (Flutter)

A sophisticated health monitoring application that calculates Body Mass Index based on user input. This project is a major step forward, introducing **Multi-Screen Architecture** and **Custom Theming**.

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes
By building this project, you will learn:
- **Navigation:** Using `Navigator.push` to switch screens and pass data forward.
- **Theming:** implementing a custom `ThemeData.dark()` to give the app a consistent, professional look.
- **Refactoring UI:** creating custom widgets (`ReusableCard`, `RoundIconButton`) to reduce code duplication.
- **Separation of Concerns:** Moving complex math logic out of the UI file and into a separate `CalculatorBrain` class.

## 📱 Features
- **Gender Selection:** Custom card selectors with active/inactive color states.
- **Height Slider:** A fluid slider widget to capture precise height data.
- **Results Page:** A separate screen that interprets the BMI score (e.g., "Normal", "Overweight") and provides health advice.
- **Dark Mode UI:** A sleek, modern user interface.
